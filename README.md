## Case Study: Interactive Dashboard for Designer Performance Tracking

### Introduction

**Company Background:**  
The e-commerce company in question has experienced significant growth over the years, achieving great success in selling medical-related items on Amazon and across the USA. With a product catalog exceeding 2000 items and continually expanding, the company faces challenges in managing design implementations. Ensuring that every design aligns with the brandâ€™s cohesive and unified identity is crucial for maintaining a consistent customer experience.

**Problem Statement:**  
One of the major setbacks encountered was the transition from the old Amazon barcode system to a more versatile UPC system. This transition was not well-planned, and due to a lack of familiarity with the design process among stakeholders, the company accumulated a substantial backlog of design changes. Delays in artwork implementation not only affect production timelines but also risk the possibility of products being out of stock online if the changes are not completed promptly. Such delays can significantly impact customer satisfaction and sales.

### Project Overview

**Objective:**  
Develop an interactive dashboard using Google Looker Studio to monitor and analyze the performance of a design team working on artwork for the e-commerce brand. The dashboard provides key metrics such as SKU IDs, job completion counts, task times, designer names, average task times, and total worked hours.

**Data Source:**  
Google Sheets containing detailed records of design tasks, including SKU IDs, job completion times, task types, and designer names.

### Process

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - **Source:** Google Sheets with entries for design jobs including SKU IDs, completion times, task types, and designer names.
   - **Cleaning:** Standardized data to ensure consistency and accuracy for reliable analysis.

2. **Dashboard Design:**
   - **Tool Used:** Google Looker Studio.
   - **Features Included:**
     - **SKU ID Summary:** Lists all SKU IDs associated with completed jobs.
     - **Job Completion Metrics:** Displays the number of jobs completed by each designer.
     - **Task Time Analysis:** Shows the time taken to complete each task and calculates the average time per task type.
     - **Designer Information:** Highlights designer names and total worked hours.
     - **Average Time & Total Hours:** Insights into average task times and total hours worked by each designer.

3. **Design & Usability:**
   - **Interactive Filters:** Allows filtering by date range, designer names, and task types.
   - **Visualizations:** Bar charts for job completions and worked hours, line graphs for task time trends, and tables for SKU ID and designer data.

4. **Implementation:**
   - **Integration:** Linked Google Sheets as the data source in Google Looker Studio.
   - **Deployment:** Shared the dashboard with the design team and project managers for real-time performance tracking.

### Outcomes

- **Comprehensive Insights:** Provides a clear overview of designer contributions, job completions, and task times.
- **Enhanced Productivity:** Facilitates better workload management and optimization by providing actionable insights into average task times and total worked hours.
- **Informed Decision-Making:** Supports data-driven decisions with real-time visibility into designer performance and task efficiency.

### Conclusion

The interactive dashboard created in Google Looker Studio successfully addresses the needs of the design team working on e-commerce artwork projects. By integrating data from Google Sheets and incorporating interactive features, the dashboard delivers valuable insights that help streamline operations and support strategic decision-making. This solution has proven effective in managing the complexities associated with the large volume of products and the critical need for timely artwork updates.
